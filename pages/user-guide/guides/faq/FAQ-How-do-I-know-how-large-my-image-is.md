### How do I know how large my image is?

Starting with version 1.1.0, MyPaint features a frame tool which allows
you to control how big your document is, and this has a "Crop to
Document" command.
The image size can be adjusted in pixels, mm, or other units, by using the *Tool Options Panel* on the [[UI Toolbar|v1.2 UI Toolbar]] (the cog button).

The canvas is still infinite, however.
