### How do I customize shortcuts?

In the 1.2.0 version under development: head to the preferences window.
There's a tab wich allows you to edit the keyboard shortcuts there.

In older versions: hover the cursor over the menu entry and click the shortcut you want to assign. This is also documented under the "Help" menu in the application itself.
