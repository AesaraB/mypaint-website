### How can I save some colors I use often between sessions?

As of 1.1.1-alpha, you can bookmark the colour you want to the palette
window.

For earlier versions, you can use the scratchpad feature, that is saved
independently of the image you're working on. The scratchpad is
essentially a mini canvas. You can add your preferred colors to it using
any brush and then save it. You can later reopen it for use with other
images. (Note: Sometimes the scratchpad is accidentally overwritten. Be
sure to back up the "scratchpads" folder in your ".mypaint"
periodically.)
