- [Ora Tools](http://gitorious.org/openraster/) (meaning OpenRaster tools) allows to open/save OpenRaster (MyPaint working fileformat) with Gimp. - The name "OraTools" has apparently been replaced with "OpenRaster", probably due to OraTools being an Oracle tool.

### Controllers
If you have a controller or other device that you can sit beside your tablet and use, then you can assign keyboard commands to it with a program such as [QJoyPad](http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/) or [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/). This reduces desktop space use and can be helpful for those struggling to learn and/or quickly find normal keyboard shortcuts.
