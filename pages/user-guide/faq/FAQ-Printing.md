### How do I print the work I created using MyPaint?

As of August 2015, there is no "Print" functionality in MyPaint, so you
will have to use another application. For instance GIMP, or a image
viewer with printing functionality.

#### Why does not MyPaint have printing functionality?

Creating a good print dialog is a lot of work. And since not that many
use printing, and it is very easy to use another application for this
operation we do not see a good reason to implement this. People also
like to do post-processing before printing, and might expect things to
be color managed, all things we do not plan to support in the short
term. Better to focus on the drawing/painting part of our painting
application. ;)
