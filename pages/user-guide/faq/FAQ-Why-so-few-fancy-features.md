*Part of the MyPaint [[FAQ]].*

### Why does MyPaint not implement resizing, selection manipulating, color adjustments etc.?

We are not planning to implement these features in the forseeable
future, simply because we think there are a lot of things that makes
more sense to focus on. If you consider such features to be absolutely
essential to your workflow, consider using Krita or GIMP instead.

If you only use them for part of the workflow, you can change
applications for these actions, see question 8.
