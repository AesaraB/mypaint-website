### Can I get OpenRaster image previews in my file browser?

As of August 2015 this is possible for most GNU/Linux desktop
environments. Sometimes you will have to install some additional
packages. We are hoping to make this "just work" on all platforms with
time. For more information see [OpenRaster Desktop Integration @ fd.o](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/OpenRaster/DesktopIntegration).
