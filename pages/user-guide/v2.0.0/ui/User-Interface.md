### Appearance

When MyPaint is first opened, you'll see a single window appear with not much in it. In the centre, there's a plain off-white paper background where you can draw. At the top, there are toolbars and menus. At the bottom, there's a status bar with some buttons and indicators clustered in the corners.

With a bit of customization you can set up sidebars full of dockable panels and palettes. You can make the MyPaint use the full screen area too, and tell it to hide the controls while you're working.
