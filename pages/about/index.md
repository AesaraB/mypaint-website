# The story
MyPaint began in 2004 when Martin Renold bought himself a Wacom 
graphics tablet. He noticed that the [program][gimp] he was using would 
sometimes drop a stroke when scribbling too fast. He thought he could 
be more expressive if his brush reacted in a different way to pressure 
and speed.

Martin wrote a few prototypes, and applied what he'd learned in his 
engineering studies. His simple program grew into a brush editor with a 
simple digital canvas. In 2006 Martin released version 0.4, and thought 
it was complete. MyPaint now did everything he wanted it to do, but 
artists found it and began to use it. Some of them asked for features 
that Martin also wanted, so development continued. Since then, many 
more have contributed to the code, or spread the word about MyPaint on 
the Internet.

# MyPaint Today
Fast-forward to today. MyPaint is a nimble, distraction-free, and easy 
tool for digital painters. It supports graphics tablets made by Wacom, 
and many similar devices. Its brush engine is versatile and 
configurable, and it provides useful, productive tools.

The standard brushes can emulate traditional media like charcoal, 
pencils, ink, or paint. But you don't have to limit yourself to just 
the standard ones. It’s easy to make expressive, artful new brushes 
that don’t respond like anything conventional.

Fullscreen mode declutters the interface, leaving you with just your 
brush and your creativity. You can still reveal the tools you want, 
when you need them. This distraction-free approach means you can focus 
better on the art you make, not the tool you make it with.

MyPaint has simplicity, yet it gives you all the tools you need to 
create great artwork.

# Community
Many notable artists use MyPaint, including digital illustrator and 
concept artist [David Revoy][revoy]. You'll find growing MyPaint user 
communities places like [DeviantArt][da]. MyPaint comes 
from the Linux art world, but it has Mac OS X and Windows ports too. 
Now anyone can pick up MyPaint and draw to their heart's content!
