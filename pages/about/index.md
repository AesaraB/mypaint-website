# What is the MyPaint Project?
The MyPaint project is a community-led development effort for a simple and intuitive
[rasterised digital painting tool][wiki-raster].
The code has been built over many years by volunteer developers and artists to be
what it is today. We need your ongoing help to [develop the program]({{< ref "/design/contributing" >}}).

# History

## Martin Renold
See also: [Developer Monologue: Short History of MyPaint]({{< ref "/blog/2009/06-18-developer-monologue" >}})

MyPaint began in 2004 when Martin Renold bought himself a Wacom 
graphics tablet. He noticed that the [program][gimp] he was using would 
sometimes drop a stroke when scribbling too fast. He thought he could 
be more expressive if his brush reacted in a different way to pressure 
and speed.

Martin wrote a few prototypes, and applied what he'd learned in his 
engineering studies. His simple program grew into a brush editor with a 
simple digital canvas. In 2006 Martin released version 0.4, and thought 
it was complete. MyPaint now did everything he wanted it to do, but 
artists found it and began to use it. Some of them asked for features 
that Martin also wanted, so development continued. Since then, many 
more have contributed to the code, or spread the word about MyPaint on 
the Internet.
