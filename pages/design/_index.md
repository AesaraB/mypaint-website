The MyPaint UX/UI specifications provides a clear reference of the MyPaint user experience, and gives developers guidelines on how to develop user-exposed features.

# Motivations
Without a descriptive and explicit set of guidelines for designing the UX/UI of MyPaint, the application will become incoherent and unintuitive.
