MyPaint's [human interface guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines) sets out rules to help developers maintain consistency in the [user experience]({{ .ref "/design/uxui" }}). Additionally, by providing these guidelines, developers have a point of reference when justifying inconsistent design.
