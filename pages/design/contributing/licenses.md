MyPaint is a [copyleft][wiki-copyleft], [open source][wiki-foss-def] project. Products
made by the MyPaint project may be considered a public good, of sorts, and their
existence from a legal perspective must be representative of this. The MyPaint project
actions this by distributing original work under [open licenses][wiki-open-license].
As a contributor to the project, you must agree to dedicate your work under specific
open licenses in order for us to be able to include it in our products.<!--more-->

# Users' Rights
- Users must have the right to freely license original works created using
an unmodified MyPaint drawing application distributed by the MyPaint project.

# Types of works
## Backgrounds and palettes
> It is highly probable that background images and palette files will become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, backgrounds and palettes must must be [public domain][wiki-public-domain].
This may be accomplished using the the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0] dedication.

The statement may appear in a README file, embedded in the image metadata or comments
fields. GIMP palette files have a description field which can be used for the same purpose.

## Brush packs
### Raw brush settings (files ending with ".myb")
> Raw brush settings in a brush pack are copied around very enthusiastically by
the MyPaint program. It is highly probable that raw brush settings will become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, brush settings must be [public domain][wiki-public-domain].
This may be accomplished using the the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0] dedication.

### Other files
Other files are not raw brush settings (files ending with ".myb"). This may include
preview packages and supplemental cover-type artwork.

> Other files in a brush pack are self-contained, and should not become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, other files must be distributed [openly][wiki-open-license]
using one of the following dedications:
- Public domain deed ([Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0])
    - You will still be credited unless you request otherwise.
- [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International][CC-BY]
- [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][CC-BY-SA]



## Supplemental artwork or promotional material
> Supplemental artwork and promotional material is content distributed with the
intent of being used miscellaneously by the MyPaint project, or by third-parties
when referencing MyPaint and the MyPaint project. 

To be included in the MyPaint project, supplemental artwork and promotional material
must be distributed [openly][wiki-open-license] using one of the following dedications:
- [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International][CC-BY]
- [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][CC-BY-SA]

If you posted your work on our [Community Forums](http://community.mypaint.org)
or in Github issues, you'll need to provide this additional license on the post
in a human-readable form and allow us to redistribute under just that license.
Embedded metadata would be ideal for other situations.

We suggest marking images intended for use as promotional screenshots with the text “© \<\<YEAR\>\> \<\<YOUR NAME\>>, CC BY-SA 4.0”, in a readable but unobtrusive fashion.

# Program code
* **Program code**, icons, and artwork for display within the program: use **GNU GPLv2+** for new code; retain existing licenses when modifying stuff
All new program code and supplemental data files should be licensed under the GNU GPLv2.0, with the "or (at your option) any later version" clause. They *must* be licensed in a way that is compatible with this. This includes program icons and artwork for display within the program. Retain the existing license boilerplates when working on existing code.

Please put a boilerplate header on each new program file in the format recommended by the license itself. It's fine for individual programmers to claim copyright over new files which originate with them.
