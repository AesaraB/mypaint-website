### Contributing Artwork
You can contribute to MyPaint
by [creating artwork][contrib.wiki] which we can reuse.
We'd like all sorts of designs for use in the program,
as part of website designs, or for promotional purposes.

If you want (and only with your permission),
you can contribute artwork which helps us promote MyPaint,
or for use in the program itself.
The work will have to abide by our [Licensing Policy][contrib.licensing].

If you want to share a tutorial,
brushes, or other
resources for MyPaint and get feedback,
please share them in the
[Resources][contrib.resources] category
on our discussion forums.

MyPaint's interface is graphically fairly simple, but there are tasks which need an artist's eye.

* Get involved: [list of open artwork requests][artissues].
* Have you created some cool brushes for MyPaint? [[Share them with others|Brush Packages]]!
* Go deeper: craft beautiful backgrounds, make tutorials, ask for your brush pack to be included...

MyPaint's icons are primarily SVG symbolic icons, rendered at 16x16 pixels.
For certain uses such as the toolbar, we ask for 24x24 pixel versions too.
Try to be pixel-exact when designing icons,
that way the icons will look good at the sizes we need.

There is an Inkscape template for icon designers,
and an extraction script in the `svg` folder.


TODO: mention screenshots, website etc.

### Licensing

Our standard backgrounds and brush definitions
really need to be usable by anyone, for any purpose, in any artwork,
without royalty payments or legal encumbrances.
This means we we have particularly stringent requirements of openness
for the standard MyPaint brush packs and paper textures.
See the [Licensing Policy][licensepol] in the wiki for details.
