MyPaint's interface is graphically fairly simple, but there are tasks which need an artist's eye.

* Get involved: [list of open artwork requests][artissues].
* Have you created some cool brushes for MyPaint? [[Share them with others|Brush Packages]]!
* Go deeper: craft beautiful backgrounds, make tutorials, ask for your brush pack to be included...

MyPaint's icons are primarily SVG symbolic icons, rendered at 16x16 pixels.
For certain uses such as the toolbar, we ask for 24x24 pixel versions too.
Try to be pixel-exact when designing icons,
that way the icons will look good at the sizes we need.

There is an Inkscape template for icon designers,
and an extraction script in the `svg` folder.


TODO: mention screenshots, website etc.

### Licensing

Our standard backgrounds and brush definitions
really need to be usable by anyone, for any purpose, in any artwork,
without royalty payments or legal encumbrances.
This means we we have particularly stringent requirements of openness
for the standard MyPaint brush packs and paper textures.
See the [Licensing Policy][licensepol] in the wiki for details.
