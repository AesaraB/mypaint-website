summary = "The philosophies behind MyPaint's user experience and user interface"
+++

- MyPaint should make the act of drawing as simple as possible.
	- A new user should immediately know how find to every feature in MyPaint.
		- Deduction test: Get a new user, describe a feature to them, and ask them where they might find it.
		- Induction test: The user wants to do something that is a capability of MyPaint, but has never used the capability before. Can they find our implementation of the capability?
- The user should be able to tailor their workflow
	- The capabilities of MyPaint should scale with the needs of the user
	- Every part of the UI with few exceptions should be able to be moved or hidden
