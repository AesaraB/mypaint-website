# Features
- MyPaint's powerful in-house brush engine
	- The standard brushes can emulate traditional media like charcoal, 
pencils, ink, or paint
	- Easily create expressive, artful new brushes that don’t respond like
anything conventional
- Best in class drawing experience
	- Focus on the art you make, not the tool you make it with.
	- Fullscreen mode declutters the interface, leaving you with just your 
brush and your creativity. You can still reveal the tools you want, 
when you need them.
