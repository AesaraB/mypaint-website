MyPaint is a nimble, distraction-free, and easy tool for digital painters.
It supports graphics tablets made by Wacom, and many similar devices.
Its brush engine is versatile and configurable, and it provides useful, productive tools.

# Features
The standard brushes can emulate traditional media like charcoal, 
pencils, ink, or paint. But you don't have to limit yourself to just 
the standard ones. It’s easy to make expressive, artful new brushes 
that don’t respond like anything conventional.

Fullscreen mode declutters the interface, leaving you with just your 
brush and your creativity. You can still reveal the tools you want, 
when you need them. This distraction-free approach means you can focus 
better on the art you make, not the tool you make it with.

MyPaint has simplicity, yet it gives you all the tools you need to 
create great artwork.
