MyPaint is an easy, nimble, and distraction-free tool for painting and sketching
from scratch. It has a versatile and configurable brush engine, and features
many useful tools to improve productivity.<!--more-->

At the heart of MyPaint is a beautifully simple painting experience, yet enough
extensibility to keep more advanced users satisfied.

# Features
- Graphic tablet support
- MyPaint's powerful in-house brush engine
	- The standard brushes can emulate traditional media like charcoal, 
pencils, ink, or paint
	- Easily create expressive, artful new brushes that don’t respond like
anything conventional
- Best in class drawing experience
	- Focus on the art you make, not the tool you make it with.
	- Fullscreen mode declutters the interface, leaving you with just your 
brush and your creativity. You can still reveal the tools you want, 
when you need them.
