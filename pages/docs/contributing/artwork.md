## MyPaint Screenshots

# MyPaint
MyPaint's interface is graphically fairly simple, but there are tasks which need
an artist's eye.
## Icons
MyPaint's icons are primarily SVG symbolic icons, rendered at 16x16 pixels. For
certain uses such as the toolbar, we ask for 24x24 pixel versions too. Try to be
pixel-exact when designing icons, that way the icons will look good at the sizes
we need.

There is an Inkscape template for icon designers, and an extraction script in the
`svg` folder.

## Backgrounds

## Brush Packages
Have you created some cool brushes for MyPaint? [[Share them with others|Brush Packages]]!

# Licensing
Our standard backgrounds and brush definitions really need to be usable by anyone,
for any purpose, in any artwork, without royalty payments or legal encumbrances.
This means we we have particularly stringent requirements of openness for the standard
MyPaint brush packs and paper textures. See the [Licensing Policy][licensepol] in
the wiki for details.
