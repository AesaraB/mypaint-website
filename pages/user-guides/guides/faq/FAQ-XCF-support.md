### Can MyPaint save in Gimp XCF format so layers can be preserved when the canvas is ready to be moved to it?

*See also [[the interoperability FAQ entry|FAQ interoperability]].*

No. MyPaint can't save in Gimp XCF format, but it's possible to save as
OpenRaster if you want layers to be preserved.

The current version of GIMP has built-in ORA support; for earlier
versions, the plugin at <http://registry.gimp.org/node/18435> can be
used.
