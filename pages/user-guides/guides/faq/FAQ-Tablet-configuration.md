### How do I configure my tablet?

MyPaint is designed to work out of the box with many tablets,
however some desktop environments require some special setup
to work with especially fancy tablets.

Since version 1.1.0,
you can rebind tablet buttons 2 and above
to certain functions within MyPaint,
provided they act as ordinary numeric "mouse" buttons.
These bindings can use the shift, ctrl, and alt keys.

Advanced users on Linux may wish to try
[easystroke](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/easystroke/wiki>),
which supports "mouse" gestures
in a generic way.
Easystroke can be tailored to suit individual applications.
