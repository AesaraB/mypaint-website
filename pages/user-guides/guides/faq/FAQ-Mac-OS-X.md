### Is MyPaint available for Mac OS X?

Sure! See [[Packaging]].

At the time of writing (29 Mar 2016), there's an established MacPorts build available for the most recent stable release (1.2.0) and a separate one for the development version. There is a binary build available through Homebrew Cask too, but it is outdated and unsupported by us (1.0 is too old, sorry!)

#### The Mac OS version does not work! :boom:

The MacPorts build is still slightly experimental. [Please report problems with it on the MacPorts issue tracker](https://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets). You might be able to get help from other MyPaint users through the [MyPaint Community Forums](http://community.mypaint.org/) too.
