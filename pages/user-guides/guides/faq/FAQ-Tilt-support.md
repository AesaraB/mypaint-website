### Does MyPaint support tilt, for Intuos and Cintiq?

MyPaint has supported tilt since version 0.8. In MyPaint 0.9, you can
try it with 'marker-flat' and 'marker-small' in the brush presets
bundled with MyPaint at installation. (little arrow in the top-right
corner of the brush icon is a symbol to indicate the usage of tilt).
