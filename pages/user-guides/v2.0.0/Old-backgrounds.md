## Getting all of the old backgrounds

Before the 2.0 release, some of the old backgrounds were removed, and all of the backgrounds were replaced with optimized versions which _should be_ basically indistinguishable from the originals.

However, if you want to use the old backgrounds, or some of the removed ones, you can download them from the link below.
Follow the installation instructions in the `README.txt` file in the zip archive.
