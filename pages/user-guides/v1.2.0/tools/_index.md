## Anatomy of a stroke
When you paint a stroke, the result is defined by different parts of MyPaint. You can combine any _Painting Tool_, _Brush_ and _Paint Mode_ to suit your drawing style. MyPaint uses one and the same engine for all kinds of brushes (and the eraser).

* Painting Tool: Defines how the **shape** of a stroke is made
* Brush: Defines the **look** of the stroke
* Paint Mode: Defines how the resulting color is **applied** to the canvas.


## The Painting Tools
The general painting tools change the input method of strokes and can be used to construct geometrical shape. The lines that are created will be made with the current brush, colour, and paint blend mode.

* [[Freehand|v1.2-Freehand-Tool]] - free drawing without constraints
* [[Inking|v1.2-Inking-Tool]] - smooth Strokes than can be modified
* Lines and Curves
* Connected Lines
* [[Ellipses and Circles|v1.2-Ellipses-and-Circles]]

## Other Tools
MyPaint also offers Tools for [[Navigation|v1.2-Main-Toolbar#view-main]], [[canvas tools|v1.2-Main-Toolbar#core-tools]] and the colour picker.
