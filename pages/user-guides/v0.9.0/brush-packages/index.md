## Concept Design (C\_D)

[[Brush-Packages-ConceptDesign-ramon.png]]

"Concept Design" idea comes from conceptual design, where Markers and
inks are very useful. I thought that it would be fun to have something
similar inside mypaint so i made them.

Extra brushes from [Ramón Miranda](http://ramonmiranda.com/) aka TheShock.

# Installing a Brush Package

[[Brush-Packages-v0.9-ImportBrushPack001.png]]

Download the ZIP file. Don't extract it.
In MyPaint, open the *Brush* menu (or right-click on the brush group labels).
Choose *Import brush package* and select the ZIP file.

If a brush or group of the same name already exists, you will have the
choice to overwrite or import with a different name.

See [[User Manual v0.9.0]] for how to uninstall or create a brush package.
