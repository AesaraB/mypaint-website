MyPaint is an easy-to-use painting program which works well with Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. \
It comes with a large brush collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, \
but the highly configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
