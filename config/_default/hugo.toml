MyPaint is an easy-to-use painting program which works well with Wacom graphics
tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large brush collection including
charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the highly configurable brush engine
allows you to experiment with your own brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
